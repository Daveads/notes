<h2 id="the-universe-is-not-indifferent"><a class="header" href="#the-universe-is-not-indifferent">The Universe is not indifferent</a></h2>
<p>when we decide to crate anything----------science, tech or to advance in the direction of a higher , nobler version of ourselves, we uncork from the universe, ineluctably, an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>That reaction is Resistance </p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Resistance is an active, intelligent, protean malign force---tireless, relentles whose sole object is to stop us from becoming our best selves and from achieving our higher goals.
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The universe is not indifferant. it is actively hostile.</strong></p>
<pre><code>We can never eliminate Resistance. It will never
go away. But we can outsmart it, and we can enlist
allies that are as powerful as it is.

</code></pre>
<p><strong>One thing not permited to do is take resistance lightly</strong></p>

<p>When an idea pops into our head and we think, “No, this is too crazy,”
… that’s the idea we want.</p>
<p>When we think, “This notion is completely off the wall … should I even
take the time to work on this?”
… the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Never doubt the soup. Never say no.
The answer is always yes.</p>

<pre><code>A work-in-progress generates its own energy field.
You, the artist or entrepreneur, are pouring love into

<p>is fame and ego (not to mention crazed fans, the press, agents, sponsors and ex-wives) works against the players chances for on-court success.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. It does not arise from rivals,
bosses, spouses, children, terrorists, lobbyists, or political adversaries.

<p>The sixth principle of Resistance (and the key to overcoming it) is that
Resistance arises second.</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
What comes first is the idea, the passion, the
dream of the work we are so excited to create that it
scares the hell out of us.
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Resistance is the response of the frightened, petty, small-time ego to the
brave, generous, magnificent impulse of the creative self.</p>
<pre><code>It means that before the dragon of Resistance
reared its ugly head and breathed fire into our faces,
there existed within us a force so potent and life-
affirming that it summoned this beast into being,
perversely, to combat it.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Resistance is more like the pain-in-the-ass schoolteacher who won’t let us climb that tree in the playground</strong></p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Love for the material, love for the work, love for
our brothers and sisters to whom we will offer our
work as a gift.
&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p><strong>In Greek, the word is eros. Life force. Dynamis, creative drive.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Principle Number Seven: The Opposite of Resistance Is Assistance</strong></p>

“You’re too young, you’re too inexperienced; you’ve got no credentials, no
credibility. Everyone who’s tried this has failed and you will, too. It can’t be
done. Your plane will crash, you’re going to drown, you’re a madman who
is attempting the impossible and you deserve whatever dire fate befalls
you!”

these universal forces of Assistance—this dream, this passion to make the
